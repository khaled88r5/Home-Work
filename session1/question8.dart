  // What is the difference between the num and double data types in Dart?

void main() {
  // num is a superclass for both int and double. It can hold either integer or floating-point values.
  // double is specifically for floating-point numbers.
  num a = 5; // This can be an int
  num b = 5.5; // This can be a double
